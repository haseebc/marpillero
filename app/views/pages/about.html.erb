                            <p> My story...I started life as a cyber security engineer and then learnt to code.  
                            </p>
                            <p> I like to develop web applications, mostly using Ruby on Rails and JavaScript. Full Stack Development is my thing.
                            </p>
                            <p> Mostly I'm based in Barcelona with my family but work stuff often means I'm scattered around Europe.
                            </p>

                        <p>However, very few developers or engineers have the resources to mitigate these attacks as  existing cyber security detection tools, whilst great at what they do, are not effective for identifying the overall important risks. </p>
